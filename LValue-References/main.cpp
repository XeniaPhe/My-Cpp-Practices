/*
 Important notes to remember :
 
	1 => References must be initialized, pointers are not required to be initialized (but should be).
	2 => References are not objects, pointers are.
	3 => References can not be reseated (changed to reference something else), pointers can change what they are pointing at.
	4 => References must always point at an object, pointers can point to nothing (weâ€™ll see an example of this in the next lesson).
